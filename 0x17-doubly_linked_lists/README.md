What is a Doubly Linked List -https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/C5_IRM981SVn8oA8RP3gag
					Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

						General
What is a doubly linked list
How to use doubly linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help


						Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
						
						Requirements
						General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free, printf and exit
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded


# 0x17. C - Doubly linked lists

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a doubly linked list
* How to use doubly linked lists
* Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

---

### [0. Print list](./ 0-print_dlistint.c)
* Write a function that prints all the elements of a dlistint_t list.


### [1. List length](./1-dlistint_len.c)
* Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked dlistint_t list.


### [2. Add node](./2-add_dnodeint.c)
* Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a dlistint_t list.


### [3. Add node at the end](./3-add_dnodeint_end.c)
* Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a dlistint_t list.


### [4. Free list](./4-free_dlistint.c)
* Write a function that free a dlistint_t list.


### [5. Get node at index](./5-get_dnodeint.c)
* Write a function that returns the nth node of a dlistint_t linked list.


### [6. Sum list](./6-sum_dlistint.c)
* Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a dlistint_t linked list.


### [7. Insert at index](./7-insert_dnodeint.c)
* Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.


### [8. Delete at index](./8-delete_dnodeint.c)
* Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a dlistint_t linked list.


### [9. Crackme4](./100-password)
* Find the password for crackme4.


### [10. Palindromes](./102-result)
* A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.


### [11. crackme5](./103-keygen.c)
* Write a keygen for crackme5.
